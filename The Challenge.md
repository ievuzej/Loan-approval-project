# Loan-approval-project

Background to the challenge:
_Zappy Financial Services is a local company that provides small business loans. Last year, loan
applications increased by over 200%, largely as a result of a concerted online push to establish a
strong digital presence. Almost all loan applications and business leads are generated from search
engines and digital ads, reflecting the decision to increase ad spend on SEO channels such as
Google, Facebook, LinkedIn etc.
Despite a strong digital marketing approach, the current loan application process remains manual.
All applications are reviewed and approved by the loan team, which given the recent increase in
volumes, has resulted in skills shortages, longer loan approval times and increased potential
operational and control risk. It is clear that the current operating model constrains further growth.
Loan decisions are categorised as either “approved” or “rejected.”
You have been tasked with providing a scalable solution – that addresses key resourcing and
control risks. The ExCo has instructed you to develop several partial automation processes that
will complement the existing loans team, freeing up time for greater one-on-one customer contact.
Your role is to provide a data-driven solution while working with a variety of key stakeholders each
with varying objectives such as marketing, internal audit, compliance etc.
The current loan application process requires the online completion of information, including
gender, marital status, number of dependents, education, income etc. To date, several of these
factors have been considered in the approval decision.
An in-house database administrator was able to compile a PDF of past applications which we are
hoping to map to previous loan approval outcomes. This data is sourced from in-house databases
and several manually updated spreadsheets from the loan department._
